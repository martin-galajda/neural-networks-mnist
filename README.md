# Neural networks - MNIST

This is implementation of neural networks for solving MNIST dataset in C++ without use of any deep learning framework (or library for performing efficient matrix operations).


# Goal
- Learn underlying  concepts of neural networks by implementing all operations in C++
- Understand optimizations made in deep learning frameworks
- Experience how math sometimes doesn't work in computers (numerical computation errors)


# Plans for future
- ~~convolutional layers~~
- ~~pooling layers~~
- batch normalization
- improve design & usability, make it more generic
